>> Nadim had a hamster. 
>> He called it Jaws.

"Jaws is a funny name for a hamster," said Biff.

Nadim put Jaws in his cage, but he forgot to shut the cage door.

Jaws got out of the cage and ran away.

Nadim saw the cage was open. "Oh no!" he said.

Nadim was upset. "Jaws has run away." he said.

The children looked for Jaws. They looked and looked.

>> Biff looked under the sink. 
>> Chip looked in the fridge. Nadim lookod under the cupboard.

Nadim's Dad looked for Jaws He pulled up the floorboards.
"Maybe Jaws is down here," he said.

Then Chip had an idea. "Let's get Floppy," he said. "He can find Jaws."

Sniff, sniff, went Floppy.

Sniff, sniff! SNIFF! SNIFF! "Look in here," said Chip.

Jaws was in the clothes basket. He had made a nest.

"Look!" said Nadim. "You can see why I called him Jaws."
