Floppy was dreaming that he was in the desert.

It was hot in the desert.
>> The sand was hot. 
>> "Ouch!" said Floppy.

Floppy saw a girl on a horse.

The girl was Biff

"Quick! Come with me," said Biff.

"A sandstorm is coming."

The wind blew the sand.
Biff put Floppy on the horse.

> The horse went fast. "Go faster!" said Biff. The sandstorm is coming!l"

>> The horse went faster. 
>> "Ouch!" said Floppy.

The horse stopped. Oh no!

Floppy flew off the horse.
"Ouch!" said Floppy.

"Oh! There's my cactus," said Biff.
