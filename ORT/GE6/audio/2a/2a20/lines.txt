# Floppy's Bath

Floppy saw a rabbit.

Floppy chased it
It went under a fence.

Floppy got wet.

Floppy got muddy.

They took Floppy home.
"What a soggy doggy!" said Kipper.

They put Floppy in the bath.
Mum and Dad washed him.

Biff and Chip dried Floppy.

Floppy looked clean.
"What a good dog!" said Kipper.

Oh no!
