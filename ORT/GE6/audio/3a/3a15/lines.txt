Dad put a rug on the sand.

Mum got out the picnic.
>> "Yum! Egg sandwiches!"
>> said Biff.

"Tuck in!"said Mum.
"And do not get sand in the sandwiches,"said Dad.

A paraglider went by.

>> "I bet that is fun,"
>> said Biff.

>> The paraglider landed. 
>> They ran to see it.

It was Miss Green, Kipper's teacher.

>> A man landed on the sand. 
>> "This is Ken,"
>> said Miss Green.
A sandwiche landed on Kipper.

>> "Oh no!Gulls!"
>> said Mum.
Dad ran to the Picnic.

But the gulls had it all.
"Sand, but no sandwiches,"said Dad.

"Pizza,"said Chip."Yum,yum!"
