# Floppy the Hero

A fire engine went by.

There was a fire.
Everyone ran to see.

> "Get back," said a fireman. A barn was on fire.

> A little dog ran to the barn. She barked and barked.

> Floppy ran to the barn. He jumped in the window.

> "Get Floppy," said Chip. The firemen pushed the door down.

> Floppy ran out. He had some puppies.

Everyone looked at Floppy.
"What a good dog!" everyone said.

What a hero!
