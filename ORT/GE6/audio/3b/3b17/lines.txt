# Bug Hunt

Biff and Kipper went on a bug hunt in the garden.
 
"Look!A big in the soil!"said Kipper.

Biff ran to get a jar.
 
The jar had holes in the lid for air.

>> Biff and Kipper had a good look. 
>> "What is it?"said Kipper.
 
>> "Dad has got a good insect book,"said Biff. 
>> "Let's check it!"

They put the jar down in the kitchen.
 
Mum was peckish.
"I think I will have toast and jam this morning,"she said.
 
Mum got the butter.
"What are you having?"said Chip.
 
"Toast,"said Mum. "What with?"said Chip.
Mum took the lid off the jar.
 
The bug shot out.
"A BUG!"shouted Mum.
 
"A bug on toast?"said Chip. "YUCK!"
