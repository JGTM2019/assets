A parrot flew on to the shed.
 
The parrot was green with a red head.
Dad ran down to see it. 
 
The parrot flew down and sat on Dad's head.

"Mister Haggis!"it said. 
 
>> Then it sat on Dad's arm. 
>> "Sing us a song,"
>> it said.

>> "Oh!"said Wilf.
>> "Can we keep it?"
>> "No,"said Mum.
 
>> Mum put up a poster.
>> "It is a missing parrot,"she said.

"Sing us a song,"said the parrot.
 
>> Mum got food for the parrot. 
>> "Night-night,Mister Haggis,"it said.
>> "Will it ever stop chattering?"
>> said Wilma. 
 
>> The parrot did not stop. 
>> "Night-night,Mister Haggis,"it said.
(Night-night!)

At last a man came. 
 
"Can you stop him chattering?"said Wilma.
"Yes,but you need to cover him up,"he said. 
 
"Night-night,Mister Haggis,"said the man.
