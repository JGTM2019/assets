# At the Pool

Kipper went to the swimming pool.

Wilma's mum took him.
She took Biff and Chip,too.

It was a new pool.
Everyone wanted to swim.

Kipper looked for his trunks.
He couldn't find them.

Kipper couldn't go in the pool.
"Sorry,"said the man.

Wilma's mum was in the water.
"Oh dear,"she said.

Wilma's mum took Kipper to a shop.
She bought him new trunks.

They went back to the pool.
"Oh no!"said Kipper.

"I put them on at home,"he said.
