# The Duck Race

Wilma had an idea.

The children made six ducks.
"Let's have a duck race,"said Wilma.

Mum began the race.
"Drop the ducks in,"said Mum.

The ducks went down the stream.
Oh no!Wilma's duck sank.

Chip's duck got stuck in the reeds.
Biff's duck got stuck in the weeds.

Wilf's duck got stuck on a log.
"Get it off with a stick,"said Chip.

Kipper's duck went fast.
It went past Dad's duck.

Two swans flew down.
They laned on the ducks!

"Six soggy ducks,"said Kipper.
