# The Ice Rink

Wilf and Dad went to the ice rink. They put skates on.

They went on to the ice.
"Hold my hand." said Dad.

Wilf held Dad's hand.
"This is fun," said Wilf.

> Wilf let go of his Dad's hand. He began to skate.

Whoops! Wilf sat down with a bump.
"This ice is cold," said Wilf.

Dad began to skate.
He went round the rink.

"Look at me spin!" said Dad
"Look at me jump!"

Dad got some cold drinks.
"Look out, Dad." said Wilf

Oh no! A banana skin.
