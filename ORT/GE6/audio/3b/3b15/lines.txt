# Dragon Danger

Floppy was dreaming about dragons.

Floppy saw a baby dragon with its mother.

>> The mother dragon saw Floppy. 
>> "Go away," she roared.

The dragon roared again and flapped her wings.
>> She flew towards Floppy. 
>> "Oh help!" he said.

>> WHOOSH! 
>> Flames came out of the dragon's mouth.
>> Floppy hid, 
>> but the dragon saw him.

>> Floppy ran onto a bridge. 
>> WHOOSH! More flames came oul of the dragon's mouth.
"Help" said Floppy. "The bridge is on fire."

Floppy ran back across the bridge.

He ran past a rock and saw the baby dragon again.

>> The mother dragon roared at Floppy. 
>> She flew up onto a high rock.

>> Oh no! 
>> The rock started to fall.

>> CRASH! 
>> The rock fell down.

>> but Floppy pulled the baby dragon out of danger. "Phew! 
>> Just in time," he said.

What a brave dog!
