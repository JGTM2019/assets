# Mosque School

Yasmin went to a mosque school.

Adam wanted to go.
But he was too little.

He wanted to look inside.

Adam couldn't see.
He climbed on the lamp post.

>> Adam got stuck.
>> "Oh no!"said his Mum.

> "Help!"called Adam. Everyone ran to help.

The firemen came.
They got Adam out.

"You can go to mosque school,"said Grandad.

"Hooray!"said Adam.
