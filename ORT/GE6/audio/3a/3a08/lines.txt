# Strawberry Jam

Dad wanted to make jam.

He picked some strawberries.
They were too small.

Mum took everyone to the pick-your-own.
"You can all help," said Dad.

They all picked strawberries.
Kipper put some in his pocket.

Chip took the strawberries to the car.
The car was locked.

He forgot about the strawberries.

The children had an ice cream.
It was time to go home.

The car ran over the strawberries
"Oh no!" said everyone.

"Traffic jam!" said Dad.
