# Sniff

"Will you look after Sniff today? said Mrs May.

Wilf and Wilma were happy.
They wanted to look after the puppy.

They took Sniff to the park.
The puppy was excited.

Sniff liked to roll on her back...

jump up for a stick...

run after a ball...

and bark at a cat.

Then Sniff went in the mud.

She ran after a duck.

She jumped in the pond,

and she barked at a dog.

"I am hot," said Wilf. "I want a rest."
"I am hot, too," said Wilma "I want a drink."

Mum couldn't find Sniff.
She couldn't find Wilf and Wilma.

Mum and Dad looked and looked.
"They must be lost," said Mum.

>> They were fast asleep.
>> "They are worn out," said Dad.
