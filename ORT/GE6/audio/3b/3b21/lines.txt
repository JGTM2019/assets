# Road Burner

Nadim had a car for his birthday.
 
>> "It's called the Road Burner,"he said.
>> "It can go fast!"
"Wow!It can zoom!"said Kipper.
 
The children had a go.
"It is hard to turn,"said Chip,
>> "if you go too fast."
 
A man went past on a scooter.
His wallet fell out of his pocket.
 
>> The children saw the wallet. 
>> "We need to stop him,"
>> said Biff.

>> "Stop!"they yelled. 
>> "He cannot hear us,"
>> said Chip.
 
>> But the man did not stop. 
>> He did not look back.
Nadim had a plan.
 
He put the wallet on the Road Burner.

Then he sent it off.
 
>> The scooter was fast,
>> but the Road Burner was faster.
The man saw his wallet on the Road Burner.
 
>> "Thank you,"he said. 
>> "You did me a good turn."
