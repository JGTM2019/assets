# The Ball Pit

Kipper and Anna went in the ball pit.

"I am a batman,"said Kipper.

He fell into the ball pit.

Then Anna fell into the pit.

But her glasses fell off.

"Oh no!"said Anna. "My glasses!"
"I cannot find them,"said Kipper.

Anna was upset.
"Get out of the ball pit!"said Kipper.

They all got out.

"I cannot find them,"said the man.

"We must get the balls out,"the man said.

They put the balls in a big net.

"Hooray! My glasses,"said Anna.
"A lot of things in the ball pit,"said Kipper.

"A lot of odd things!"said Anna.
