# The Monster Hunt

Gran took the children on a monster hunt,

Biff saw some monster footprints. 

Chip saw a monster glove, and...

Kipper saw the monster!

"Come on," said Gran. "Let's get that monster!"

>> The monster ran. 
>> It ran up the hill.

>> It ran into the mill... 
>> and hid.

>> "Come on," said Chip. 
>> "Let's get that monster!"

They went into the mill.

"Ssh!" said Gran. "I can see the monster's tail."

>> Gran pulled the monster's tail. 
>> "Got you!" she said.

"AARGH!" said the monster.

Crash! went a sack. Crash! went the monster.

>> The monster looked at the children. 
>> "Help!" he said

"Monsters!"
