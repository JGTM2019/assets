# The Baby-sitter

The baby-sitter came.

"Go back to bed," said Dad.

The children came downstairs.
"We couldn't sleep." they said.

Kipper got his books.
He wanted a story.

Biff was hungry.
They made a sandwich.

Chip wanted a pillow fight.
Everyone joined in.

The children went back to bed.
"What a mess!" said the baby-sitter.

Mum and Dad came back.
"Was everyone good?" said Mum.

"Yes and no," said the baby-sitter
