# Adam's Car

Adam had a new car.

He saw a car on television.
It looked like his car.

Adam had an idea.

He went to the flour bin.
He put flour on the car.

He dropped the car.
"Oh no!"said Adam.

He looked in the flour.
He couldn't find the car.

The bin fell over.
The flour went everywhere.

Mum was cross.

Adam was sorry.
