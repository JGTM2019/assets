# King of the Castle

Mum and Dad took the children to see a castle. 

A big coach was in the car park.

The castle had a moat and lots of turrets. 

"Look!"said Chip."I am a knight!"
Nadim said,"I will be a knight,too!"

"I will be the queen,"said Biff.
"Then I will be the king,"said Chip.

"No,I am the king!"said Kipper.

"I AM THE KING!"shouted a man.

Dad was high up in a ttrret.
"NOW BOW DOWN TO THE KING!"shouted Dad.

All the people from the coach saw him.
Then they all made a bow.

"Quick!We need to tell them Dad is not the king,"said Chip.
"No,"said Biff."Wait."

"Such a good castle,dear,"said a woman."And we saw the king!"
