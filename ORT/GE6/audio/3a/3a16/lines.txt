# Red Noses

Mum had a posh dress on.

She was going out.
Dad had lots of jobs to do.

Mum went off.

Chip got the paints out.

The red paint pot fell over.

Red paint ran on to Floppy.

"Floppy had a red nose,"said Chip.

Dad put a dab of red paint on Chip's nose.

"Kipper has a red nose,"said Dad.

Dad went to dab paint on Biff's nose.

"Oh no! You will not get me,"said Biff.

Dad ran to get her. Biff ran and ran.

"I will get you,"said Dad.

Oh no! Splat!

Mum had a red nose. Dad had a red face.
