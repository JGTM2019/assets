It was Kipper's birthday.

Kipper wanted a party.
Everyone wanted to come.

Biff put up balloons.
Mum made a cake.

Dad took a sandwich.
"Stop it," said Mum.

Everyone came to the party.

Dad wanted to play a game.
But Kipper put the television on.

"Oh no!" said Mum, "What a mess!"

The children played with the bubbles.

"What a good party!" everyone said.
