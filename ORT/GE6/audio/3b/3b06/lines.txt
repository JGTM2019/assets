Dad went to the building site. He took Wilf and Wilma.

They looked at the crane.
Wilma spoke to the man in the cab.

A van came to the building site.
It had a weather vane on the back.

Wilf looked at the weather vane.
Dad had an idea.

Wilf jumped over the weather vane.
"Be careful," said Dad.

"Take a photograph," said Wilma.
She jumped over the weather vane.

The weather vane went on the roof.

>> said Wilma.
>> "What a tall story!"
