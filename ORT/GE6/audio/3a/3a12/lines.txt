# The Carnival

The mums and dads were busy.

They made a giant shoe.
They put it on a trailer.

The children dressed up.
Dad was the old lady.

The giant shoe looked good.
They took it to the carnival.

The cur broke down.
"Oh no!" everyone said.

"Come on!" said Wilma.
Biff, Chip, and Wilf pushed.

"Come on!" said Kipper.
"Come on!" said everyone.

> There was an old lady. She lived in a shoe. She had so many children.

It was a good job, too.
