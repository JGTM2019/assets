# Floppy and the Bone

loppy saw a big bone.

"I want that bone." said Floppy.

So he took it!

> "Stop! Stop!" said Biff. "Drop the bone!" said Chip.

>> But Floppy didn't stop, 
>> and he didn't drop the bone!
He ran up the hill.

He ran into a wood...

>> and onto a bridge. 
>> and stopped!

Floppy looked down.
He saw a dog in the water.

The dog had a big bone.

Floppy wanted that bone, too.

> Grrrrrrr! went Floppy. SPLASH! went the bone. SPLASH! went Floppy.

>> "Oh no!" said Floppy. 
>> "The dog I saw was me!"
