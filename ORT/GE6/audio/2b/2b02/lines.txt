"Dad looks silly," said Wilma. 
"No, he looks good," said Wilf.

Dad put on a red nose.
"Oh" said Wilma "Dad looks so silly."

Dad had a bucket.
"Put your money in here," he said.

Oh no! A man took Dad's money.

But the man didn't stop.

Dad got on a bike.

The man ran fast...

"Got you," said Dad.

>> said the man.

>> "Super Dad!" 
>> said Wilma.
