# A walk in the Sun

The children went for a walk. 
 
>> They were near a farm. 
>> "I can hear a hen!"said Lee.
>> "That is a rooster,not a hen,"
>> said a man in big boots. 
 
Further along,Kipper saw a sheep.
"The farmer is giving that sheep a haircut!"he said. 
 
"He is shearing its coat,not cutting its hair,"said the man."

>> "We need to go past that farmhouse,"
>> said Mum.
 
>> "That is a barn,not a farmhouse,"
>> said the man.

"This way,"said the man. 
 
>> "I am not sure that is right,"
>> said Lee.
"That is a bull,not a cow!" 
 
It was a big bull with long horns!
"Run!"they all shouted.
 
>> "Go up that oak tree!"
>> shouted Mum.

The man went up the tree.
 
>> "This is a beech tree,not an oak,"
>> said the man.
