# The Snowman

It was snowing. "Hooray," said the children.

They saw Wilf and Wilma.
Wilf was sweeping the snow.

> Biff had a good idea. She made a giant snowball.

> Everyone pushed the snowball. Floppy barked and barked.

Wilf had an idea.
He wanted to play a trick.

The children made a giant snowman.

Wilf's dad opened the door.
He saw the snowman.

Wilma's mum took a photograph.
The snow fell off the roof.

"Six snowmen!" said Wilma's dad.
