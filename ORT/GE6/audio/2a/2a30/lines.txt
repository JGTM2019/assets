# The Foggy Day

It was foggy.

Dad wanted to go shopping.
"Oh no," said the children.

They got into the car.
They were fed up.

The fog got worse.
Dad couldn't see.

Dad stopped the car.
They had to walk home.

The fog got worse.
They were lost.

"This way," said Biff.
"No, this way," said Chip.

They saw a light.
"A monster!" said Dad.

"It's Mum!" said the children.
